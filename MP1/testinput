A test script to show a few simple tests for the sequential list ADT.
This is an example of a start to a test plan.  These tests are very incomplete.

Assumptions: these tests are designed with a list size of 3.  Also try the
script with larger and smaller sizes for the list.

TEST 1:  Add three entries to list.  

ADD 111
100
200
T
WEP
b
2.4

54.2

ADD 551

c

1.3

ADD 100 
111
200
T
WEP
a
5.0
3
11.1
3

To determine if test 1 passes look for three "Inserted" messages

TEST 2: Print the list and verify three entries are sorted 

PRINT
STATS

To deterine if test 2 passes list should be printed in order with 3 records.
Also, stats shoudl show 3 records with an array size of 3

TEST 3:  Update the 111 entry in the list

ADD 111
101
201
F
WPA2
d
2.4
4
54.4
4

To determine if test 4 passes look for "Updated" message

TEST 4: Print the list, verify entry for 111 replaced

PRINT
STATS

To determine if test 4 passes look for 3 records, and 111 record should be 
updated with Time as 4.  Stats should still be 3 records, size 3

TEST 5: look for a record in the list and one not in list

FIND 111
FIND 112

To determine if test 5 passes should print record 111 with time 4, and
should not find 112

TEST 6:  Attempt to add fourth record. If list size is 3 then add will be rejected 

ADD 222
333

5
PRINT
STATS

To check test 6, look for Rejected if list size is three.  Print shows 3 old
records Stats shows 3 records, array size 3.  If the program is run with a list
size of 4 or larger then the add should be successful.

TEST 7: Remove the last element in the list and try to remove an element 
not in the list

DEL 551
DEL 552
PRINT

To verify test 7, should see removed 551, did not remove 552, and final list
should be printed with 2 records.

TEST 8: Quit

QUIT

to verify test 8, run with valgrind and confirm there are no memory leaks
