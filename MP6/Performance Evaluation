Performance Evaluation 

 Please look at testlogPE#
 
 1.a For Graph two the complexity is O(n^2) beacuse if the number of vertices are n the the number of comparision with the vertices will not be n, it will be double i.e n^2. Therefore the complexity is O(n^2).
 If compare testlogPE1 and testlogPE2 we can easily say with N/2 number of vertices the ratio of the number of the vertices is 4.
 b. TestlogPE3
 
 2.TestlogPE4, The complexity is O(nlogn).
 
 3. The graph is not connected as testlogPE5 and testlogPE5
